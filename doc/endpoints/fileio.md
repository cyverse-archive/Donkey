# File IO

Provides a REST-like API for uploading and downloading files to and from iRODS.


## Error handling

If you try to hit an endpoint that doesn't exist, you'll get a 404.

For all other errors, you should receive a 500 HTTP status code and a JSON body in the following format:

    {
        "error_code" : "<Scruffian error code>",
        "status" : "failure"
    }

Most errors will return other contextual fields, but they will vary from error to error. For programmatic usage, only depend on the three fields listed above.

Each section listed below lists the error codes that you may encounter. In addition to these, you may run into the ERR_UNCHECKED_EXCEPTION, which means that an uncaught exception was encountered.


## Downloading

__URL Path__: /secured/fileio/download

__HTTP Method__: GET

__Request Query Parameters__:

* proxyToken - A valid CAS proxy ticket.
* path - The path to the file in iRODS to be downloaded.

__Error Codes__:

+ ERR_INVALID_JSON (wrong content-type or JSON syntax errors)
+ ERR_BAD_OR_MISSING_FIELD (JSON field is missing or has an invalid value)
+ ERR_MISSING_QUERY_PARAMETER (Query parameter is missing)

__Curl Command__:

    curl 'http://127.0.0.1:31370/secured/fileio/download?proxyToken=notReal&path=/iplant/home/testuser/myfile.txt'

This will result is the file contents being printed out to stdout. Redirect to a file to actually get the file.


## Uploading

__URL Path__: /fileio/upload

__HTTP Method__: POST

__Request Form Fields__:

* file - The contents of the file to be uploaded.
* user - The iRODS user uploading the file.
* dest - The destination directory for the file.

__Error Codes__:

+ ERR_MISSING_FORM_FIELD (One of the form data fields is missing)
+ ERR_NOT_A_USER (Invalid user specified)
+ ERR_DOES_NOT_EXIST (Destination directory doesn't exist)
+ ERR_NOT_WRITEABLE (Destination directory isn't writeable)

__Response Body__:

A success will return JSON like this:

    {
        "action" : "file-upload",
        "status" : "success",
        "file" : {
            "id" : "<path to the file>",
            "label" : "<basename of the file path>",
            "permissions" : {
                "read" : true|false,
                "write" : true|false
            },
        "date-created" : <seconds since the epoch>,
        "date-modified" : <seconds since the epoch>,
        "file-size" : <size in bytes>
    }

__Curl Command__:

Uploading is handled through multipart requests:

    curl -F file=@testfile.txt -F user=testuser -F dest=/iplant/home/testuser/ http://127.0.0.1:31370/fileio/upload

Notice that the 'dest' value points to a directory and not a file.


## URL Uploads

__URL Path__: /secured/fileio/urlupload

__HTTP Method__: POST

__Error codes__:

+ ERR_INVALID_JSON (Missing content-type or JSON syntax error)
+ ERR_BAD_OR_MISSING_FIELD (Missing JSON field or invalid JSON field value)
+ ERR_MISSING_QUERY_PARAMETER (One of the query parameters is missing)
+ ERR_NOT_A_USER (Invalid user specified)
+ ERR_NOT_WRITEABLE (Destination directory isn't writeable by the specified user)
+ ERR_EXISTS (Destination file already exists)
+ ERR_REQUEST_FAILED (General failure to spawn upload thread)
+ ERR_INVALID_URL (URL that was passed in couldn't be used)

__Request Query Parameters__:

* proxyToken - A valid CAS ticket.

__Request Body__:

    {
        "dest" : "/iplant/home/testuser/",
        "address" : "http://www.google.com/index.html"
    }

__Response Body__:

On success you should get JSON that looks like this:

    {
        "status" : "success",
        "action" : "url-upload",
        "msg" : "Upload scheduled.",
        "url" : "<URL>",
        "label" : "<URL base filename>",
        "dest" : "<destination in irods>"
    }

On on error, you'll either get a stacktrace or JSON that looks like this:

    {
        "status" : "failure",
        "action" : "url-upload",
        "msg" : "<JSON passed in through the request>",
        "error_code" : "ERR_REQUEST_FAILED"
    }

If the URL passed in is incorrect, then the error message will look like this:

    {
        "status" : "failure",
        "action" : "url-upload",
        "error_code" : "ERR_INVALID_URL",
        "url" : "<URL Passed in>"
    }

__Curl Command__:

    curl -d '{"dest" : "/iplant/home/testuser/", "address" : "http://www.google.com/index.html"}' http://127.0.0.1:31370/secured/fileio/urlupload?proxyToken=notReal

The 'dest' value in the JSON refers to the path to the directory in iRODS that the file will be saved off to. The filename of the file will be extracted from the path portion of the URL.


## Note on Uploads

Uploads are staged in a temporary directory in iRODS before being moved to their final location.
